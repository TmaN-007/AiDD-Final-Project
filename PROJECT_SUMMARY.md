## Reflection Answers

### 1. How did AI tools shape your design or coding decisions?

AI tools significantly influenced our architecture by suggesting the separation of concerns through a dedicated Data Access Layer. This wasn't explicitly in our initial plan, but the AI recommended it for better testability and maintainability. The AI also shaped our security approach by proactively suggesting input validation and parameterized queries throughout the project.

### 2. What did you learn about verifying and improving AI-generated outputs?

We learned that AI-generated code requires rigorous validation:
- Run comprehensive unit tests on all DAL methods
- Manual security review of authentication code
- Test edge cases AI might miss
- Validate AI features never fabricate data

**Key lesson**: Trust but verify. AI excels at structured, repetitive code but needs human oversight for business logic and security.

### 3. What ethical or managerial considerations emerged?

**Ethical:**
- Risk of data fabrication in AI features
- Need for transparency (clear AI labeling)
- Privacy concerns with AI data access
- Bias in AI-generated recommendations

**Managerial:**
- How to attribute AI contributions in teams
- Balancing AI assistance with skill development
- Need for robust QA when AI generates large code volumes
- Importance of documenting AI interactions

### 4. How might these tools change the role of a business technologist or product manager in the next five years?

**Role Evolution:**
- PMs become "AI orchestrators" directing AI tools
- Shift from "how to build" to "what to build"
- Technical PMs can prototype without full dev teams
- Focus increases on strategy, research, ethics

**New Skills Required:**
- Prompt engineering
- AI output validation
- Ethical oversight
- Context engineering

**Bottom line**: AI amplifies capabilities but doesn't replace PM role.
